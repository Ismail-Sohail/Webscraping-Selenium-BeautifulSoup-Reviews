0, Shweta Jindal ,"This is how I got the order from this place. I can‚Äôt trust this condition of the food, I don‚Äôt know whose is at fault either the restaurant or the delivery person. But it‚Äôs disappointing.", 1493 Finch Ave W, North York
1, Nero Odogun ,"Got my order wrong which happens. Had a sausage bacon biscuit forgot the bacon. It‚Äôs fine, I work in the restaurant industry it‚Äôs very common to make an omission during peak hours. The manager however a filipino lady is very aggressive, there is ways to talk to your staffs and customers. I work in management  so seeing how she handles omission mistake is disrespectful. Whoever you are you were extremely demeaning to your staff and us too. She literally snatched the wrong order off my partner rather than ask politely to see. Probably racist too because we were of colour. Would have been different if we were not. Hard working staffs, bad management.  Do better and be more organized. New management I presume.", 1493 Finch Ave W, North York
2, Eat with Arpit ,"They don't even have coffee there. I went there and asked if you had an espresso they refused. Then, again I went the next day, there was no espresso. Why bother opening the cafe, if you can't even serve coffee. How ironic?", 1493 Finch Ave W, North York
3, Akhilesh Dave ,I have ordered Cheese croissant toasted. The lady was making something sandwich like thing which has meat in it. And she didn‚Äôt prepared my croissant with same gloves.  She didn‚Äôt changed gloves while making my food. And I don‚Äôt want meat. I also work in food service franchise it is very unprofessional and unhygienic not to change gloves. I just walked out with my iced coffee at least that was perfect. Please work on this and if your employees doesn‚Äôt know how to work with hygiene then I‚Äôm ready to give my assistance. Thank you., 1493 Finch Ave W, North York
4, Cara Cooper ,"In TO for a couple of weeks for a course. This Tim‚Äôs is within walking distance from my air b&b and I have gone nightly for a steeped tea and sandwich for lunch the next day. You cannot even taste steeped tea, just the cream and sugar.
The sandwich is why I am taking the time to post. Although it‚Äôs in the fridge overnight, it shouldn‚Äôt be hard as rock as if it‚Äôs a week old. Where‚Äôs Tim‚Äôs quality control with this location?", 1493 Finch Ave W, North York

10, Gurkirat Singh ,"This location is One of the worst place to have coffee. Their staff does not know the difference between ""Milk"" and ""Cream"". Especially the girls who are working here does not know basic manners about how to treat customers. They work as if this is their dad's store.
I went to this store on saturday morning 16feb around 10:45 am. I ordered steap tea with milk and they gave me with cream. I ordered it again then they again gave me with cream. I asked her if this is milk and she said with confidence its milk. Wow!!!! It was cream.
I drink steap tea every day. Hats off to her confidence.

I wish if I could give 0 stars", 1493 Finch Ave W, North York

Five stars.", 1493 Finch Ave W, North York
13, Shailesh Sharma ,Of course it‚Äôs busy but the staff was comparatively fast then the other stores. Staff is really good and quick specially Superviser name Vaishali.

16, vishnu s kumar ,I ordered the dark roast coffee a couple of times and 90% of time I got the bad ones. It wasn't fresh and not stirred well. Most other Tims also have the same problem with the dark roast coffee. I believe they only bother about the original blend coffee., 1493 Finch Ave W, North York
17, Parth Rabara ,"Worst food and staff. If u order iced coffee with extra cane sugar syrup u will still get the regular, if u order bagel double toasted with extra butter u will just get the regular bagel.

7, Bharat Shah ,"A very busy place but not enough room, so it always looks over crowded. Difficult to find a place to sit down.
Customer service and staff are good, but it is not a cozy, pleasant place to enjoy with your family and/or and friends.", 3981 Jane St, North York
8, Sebastian Bias ,"They try their best and service is USUALLY good. Honestly, I feel like most of the time service slows down because of a extra picky Karen or some dude with nothing better to do but harass workers but mistakes do happen. Y'all in their shoes of working fast food or retail know what I'm talking about. üíØ

Luckilly, it's a fast food coffee shop so nothing a few minutes won't fix on an honest mistake. Quality is great!", 3981 Jane St, North York
9, Brown Arnold ,"No Star at all.
Very rude, poor customer service.
Casher Akka was yelling at me while I ask help for cashing out.

I just order some coffee and breakfast this morning by Timm apps. But they packed my order not right. I order 1 M Coffee, 2 L Iced Coffee and some breads..shipped to my house. i asked him just put and front door bc pandemic ( my mistake that‚Äôs I didn‚Äôt open the bag to check in front of him) put when i drop the bag, the bag very light not look heavy with 3 cups of coffee and some breads. As my thought, 2 Iced coffees Not Appear in the bag. I called the shipper rightway but he couldn‚Äôt speak English well. i have to call the Store because this thing happens so many time, sometime missing hashbrown, sometime coffee‚Ä¶.just small thing. Thank god! The manager spoke to me but he said it was him packed everything my order so couldn‚Äôt have any problem. I think he should go back to train himself again. The good manager who have to resolve the mistake. He can‚Äôt not say like that. So rediculious!üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé", 3981 Jane St, North York
13, Yvonne Vu ,"The place is nice, very family friendly and you're able to just sit and hangout. Although there once was a spill all over a table and some chairs and many customers informed the workers about it many times but I didn't see them clean it up. They even saw it but they just brushed it off and left it. I was there for 2 hours and during that time I saw no workers taking the initiative to clean the mess. Very sad", 3981 Jane St, North York
14, I & J Lopez Zavala ,Very disappointed in the cashier that took my order at approximately 9:30 pm that day.  She was rude and oddly enough I witnessed her be rude to a gentleman a day before too.  If she doesn't like working with people she should get another job., 3981 Jane St, North York
15, Yuvraj Chauhan ,Such an amazing customer service by Shri Lankan Lady named Trisunga(sorryfor spelling). Keep up the good work team!, 3981 Jane St, North York
16, Tine B ,With this pandemic that‚Äôs going around your employees in there yes they have mass on halfway and talking over the customers food I just came in there less than 10 minutes ago and you have your employees in the laughing talking over making my drinks and my food I literally was disgusted I have not eaten the food that you guys gave me. The same thing happened to my sister to get diesel that happened to me and it honestly gives the company a banding wear your mask prepare the food and don‚Äôt talk while you‚Äôre doing it, 3981 Jane St, North York
17, Morticia Omen ,"Powered egg breakfast sandwiches should be a thing of the past at this point.

I think that it is either a good Timmy coffee day or a bad burnt coffee kind of day. Why can't it just be the same everytime?

I don't like seeing flies in the donut display wither.

And what about the people with peanut allergies? Kind of looks like a war zone...

It would be nice if the guests can respect the rules and practice safe social distancing, instead of overcrowding the outside sidewalks.", 3981 Jane St, North York
18, K. Thompson ,This has got to be the worst Tim Horton's in Canada! It was absolutely filthy. The floor was disgusting. There was garbage everywhere. I wish I had had my phone with me as I would have posted a photo of all the garbage everywhere to this review and submitted it to head office. . Every item I originally wanted to order - except coffee - was not available. Same for the two people in line behind me. The staff were trying hard but it is difficult to serve customers when you have nothing to offer. Avoid this location and head to a different Tim's., 3981 Jane St, North York
19, Mahala Edwards ,"Service was slow. I hate having to ask for a double cup with my black coffee...should be by default that one is provided. Maybe they need to hire more people to clean their establishment. Total and complete mess in there. Garbage too full, dirty tables. I won't even mention the washroom. This is by far the worst Timmies I've seen.", 3981 Jane St, North York
20, Tiam Behdarvandan ,Always waiting over 15-30 minutes to be able to order. Very busy and very unorganized. Their cash screens are not working and they do not accept cards because their machines are down... how does this happen at Tim Hortons? This location needs help, 3981 Jane St, North York
21, Json ,Everything as expected of Tim Hortons but they tend to be inconsistent with their brew timing. I've had coffee that didn't taste like it was made fresh. This was in the afternoon/evening so everything should have already been freshly made., 3981 Jane St, North York
22, Abhilasha Kagra ,My order was taken by one of their team member(Raaj). We order 2 drinks potato wedges and one chicken wrap. She didn't assist us well she was very rude and non interested by her face and gave the food about 20 minutes later and the chicken was uncooked that's one of the worst experience I ever had with tim hortons although its was not busy at all., 3981 Jane St, North York
23, Tammy ‚ÄúGataki‚Äù White ,"Friendly,clean,fresh coffee and items", 3981 Jane St, North York
24, Jawwad Khan ,"15 minutes for a bagel on a barren day, horrible service and very hostile staff. Its better to go to the McCafe across the other side of the mall, at least they get your orders done on time.", 3981 Jane St, North York
25, Rick Chatarpaul ,"Horrible service. Cramped and trash-filled location - don't even think about sitting down. It's become a joke for my friends to see how badly they will screw up an ""Extra large, half a cream"". Last time twice served me a cup filled halfway with cream. A friend was actually asked if they could change her order because the server didn't want to make a dark roast.  Do yourself a solid and use the Tim's drive-thru at the Esso across the street or the one at Sentinel and Finch.", 3981 Jane St, North York
26, Aman Kaur ,"Very bad customer service by deepa and crew members. They gave me a wrong drink and when questioned all three team members started yelling, really disappointed", 3981 Jane St, North York
27, Julie Ly ,"I came here when I was younger a lot and the store smelt like vomit and burnt toast, it still does today. I like their ice cappucinos though. Their washrooms are disgusting, they clearly don't clean it or replace the toilet paper. I've seen men walk out of the bathroom before I went in to use it... I don't even bother to use their washrooms anymore. The Jane and Finch mall washrooms are way more cleaner.", 3981 Jane St, North York
28, Ann Link ,"It may seem really crowded and that you may not get a cup of coffee... however, they have these wonderful little booths on the outside of the restaurant where you can sit down relax and map out which stores you wish to visit that day.", 3981 Jane St, North York
29, Gregory Lee ,"Tim Hortons in Jane Finch Mall- A Bustling fast food... Ordered the Turkey melt meal which is Grilled Cheese melt on Turkey deli chunks with mayo, Steak style Friesand a Soda. However I opted for Coffee instead at no extra charge.

Food was good and filling, the Grilled bread was perfect color and texture, the turkey chunks seemed to be made from thick shredded slices which I liked because it added to the taste and texture. The Mayo was a bit warm (could've been warmer/hotter) but was ok. They are a really busy bustling place however service was quick. Had a Good Lunch. Afterwards, I windowshopped the JaneFinch Mall.... (Hey, I'm a tourist...and it's touristy to windowshop...lol).", 3981 Jane St, North York
30, Michael Saps ,Good service and good food!, 3981 Jane St, North York
31, Vicky ,overall decent place. if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll be able to find a seat. i don‚Äôt recommend this location unless you don‚Äôt know any other tim hortons close by. staff are great. the only problem is the crowding and the gross bathrooms, 3981 Jane St, North York
32, T. C.B ,Watched them pour 4 bottom of the of the pots into my cup. Horrible!  Then when she was giving me my change back ahe was more interested  in talking with her friend that she dropped my change on the counter instead of handing it to me. Expect a lot more from Tim Hortons., 3981 Jane St, North York
33, Gary A ,"EDIT: This Tim Hortons just got the large industrial coffee machines, same as the gas station nearby. This coffee tastes like coffee-flavored water.

I will not be returning here.", 3981 Jane St, North York

36, andrew medeiros ,This tims is so bad some of the people who work there don't even change there gloves when handling money to food this by far is the worst tims I've ever been to and they also make Me a different kind of coffee every time I ask for the same one . The girls there are rude and dirty no class and there are times I would be waiting 10 minutes for a sandwich because no one feels like working I could do there job with a smile on my face also and it would be so easy.., 3981 Jane St, North York
37, Leroy Staglon ,"Feb 26 19 ,855pm had to wait 10min for a sausage on a biscuit  ( eaven thow the cashier showed it it the guy  ( baker I guess) on the screen, very addamount about leaving the oven he was cleaning) to make my  sanwage.", 3981 Jane St, North York
38, AMOXY CILLIN ,"i feel like i have given this timmies a fair shot. i have been here a fair bit before leaving this review

if any location ever needed to enforce a 'no loitering' policy, holy hell would it be this one. at any given time, all (and i mean ALL) available seating is occupied by groups of people playing with the garbage of whatever they purchased hours ago.

it is the absolute loudest and borderline overwhelming tim hortons i have ever been into in my life. you have to yell to the employees your order, and  they have to yell it back to you to confirm. then yell it again when giving you your order. otherwise you just cant hear anything with all the groups of locals. this location has essentially become an extended wing of the food court", 3981 Jane St, North York
39, Vic Handa ,"Coffee usually gives me a headache.  Odly enough I find Time Hortons coffee give more headaches then from other places.  Also, the lids will leak on you.  Which is hell while driving to work in the morning.", 3981 Jane St, North York

42, Mohsin Sattar ,"Terrible location! Probably the worst I have seen with the exception of some.

47, Penn Wong ,"The service is not up to normal standard..and the facility is not clean..they have my order mixed up...at the end they didn't try to rectify it...they just refund my purchase...not a good experience...we are not from Toronto.. but from Calgary...our experience in Calgary's Tim Hortons is much better, more friendlier and cleaner", 3981 Jane St, North York
