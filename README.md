In this project, i have scrape the google reviews of Tim Hortons using selenium and beautifulsoup libraries in python. 

Steps :
1. Initially, providing the links / website of Tim Hortons to extract.
2. I used selenium functions such as find_element using "XPATH" and "TAG_NAME" to find the path and buttons for further access to the website.
3. I used BeautifulSoup library to pull the contect from the google review.
4. Javascript function execute_script is used to scroll down the page to get all the reviews.
